# ABSTRACT: Precompiled grammar for PDF::FDF::Simple
# PODNAME: PDF/FDF/Simple/Grammar.pod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the precompiled grammar. It is generated from

  lib/auto/PDF/FDF/Simple/grammar

using

  ./author-utils/precompile-grammar

usually done by the maintainer or a developer.

=head1 Developing without precompile

You can avoid using the precompiled grammar and use the raw C<grammar>
file by setting this environment variable to a true value:

  export PDF_FDF_SIMPLE_IGNORE_PRECOMPILED_GRAMMAR=1

This is useful if you want to work on the grammar without the need to
precompile everytime.

The path to the grammar file is determined using
L<File::ShareDir|File::ShareDir> in the respective C<lib/auto/>
subdirectory that belongs to the currently used module, depending on
C<@INC>. So when you get confused, e.g., by seemingly non-working
changes, check which grammar file it is using. Some typical different
C<@INC>s are used with:

  prove -l t/*.t               # ./lib/
  prove -b t/*.t               # ./blib/
  make test                    # ./blib/
  perl -MPDF::FDF::Simple ...  # perl's @INC
