  - write out form values without whitespace, this seems to fix
    reported problems with some Acrobat tools

  - some more tests with user reported forms

0.21      2009-05-07

  - fix "use Parse::RecDescent" into "require" during Build.PL

0.20      2009-04-28

  - Outsourced grammar file into lib/PDF/FDF/Simple/grammar; now
    less double-escaping in the grammar because it's no longer part of
    a quote operator.

  - Provide a precompiled grammar file for faster startup time, can
    be updated with "./Build grammar"

  - for easier development it is still possible to compile the
    grammar at runtime by setting the environment variable
    PDF_FDF_SIMPLE_IGNORE_PRECOMPILED_GRAMMAR=1

  - new dependency to File::ShareDir

0.19      2009-04-26

  - Grammar fixes provided by Eric Amick.

  - include forgotten tests and example fdf files from 0.18

  - added git repository to META.yml

0.18      2009-04-13

  - Mini synopsis update about accessing single fields.

  - Support for stream objects (RJH and Dave Barter)

  - Add parsing for StemV object (RJH and Dave Barter)

  - parsing optional /Type/* attribute plus unittest (spotted and
    test provided by Rosal Lozada)

  - new dependency to Compress::Zlib

0.17      2008-04-24

  - Bummer! Now really drop Makefile.PL.

0.16      2008-04-24

  - Switched to yet another accessor class: Class::Accessor::Fast.

  - Fixed deep recursion warnings. Tests for this. Thanks to rafl++.

  - Dropped compatibility Makefile.PL.

0.15      2008-04-15

  - Hex decoding (decode bytes via #\d\d) does not apply to field
    values values inside /V (...), only to literal values. Thanks to
    Eric Amick.

  - Fixed tests to reflect the above hex decoding change.

0.14      2008-04-11

  - Upload problems with 0.13

0.13      2008-04-06

  - More grammar enhancements for value arrays and for strange ID
    attribute values from Eric Amick.

  - Tests for new grammar changes and the xref changes from v0.12.

  - Tests for the accessor change in v0.12, that I forgot in the
    manifest.

0.12      2008-03-22

  - Switched from Class::MethodMaker to Class::Accessor, because I
    didn't like the pollution with lots of variants of my accessors
    that all do the same. Feel free to complain about this step. If
    you convince me, I might switch back. :-)

  - Grammar enhancement to handle xrefs. Provided by Eric Amick.

  - whitespace/tab cleanup

0.11      2007-07-11

  - added attribute_ufile() which handles the /UF attribute
    generated by Acro8; reported by Ed Cole.

  - small grammar tweak for slightly different Acro8 files; reported
    by Ed Cole.

  - more tests, code cleanup, docs

0.10      2005-12-18

  - fixed incorrect SYNOPSIS regarding attribute_file and
    attribute_id; reported by Brian Bay.

0.09      2005-11-13

  - fixed parsing file attribute (/F couldn't handle real world
    filenames with spaces and parens); reported by Ed Cole

0.08      2005-11-10

  - fixed parsing fields with missing values (missing /V in fdf);
    reported by Ed Cole.

  - save now also accepts an explicit filename argument

0.07      2005-08-02

  - Test::Distribution and Test::Pod::Coverage only used if
    explicitely required, because I don't want to fail remote
    installation due to those modules, which might change in future.

0.06      2005-06-03

  - The Parser now also works without initial version header in FDF
    file. This seems to be needed in FDFs that were submitted from
    Acrobat to an URL (e.g., a CGI script); reported by Christopher P
    Crawford.

  - undefined values are converted into empty strings ('') when fdf
    is generated (and/or saved), to avoid "uninitialized value"
    warnings. To avoid this, set option "skip_undefined_fields" to a
    true value (default is false); then fields whose value is
    undefined are skipped.

  - Test framework now uses Test::More (plus Test::Pod::Coverage and
    Test::Distribution if available).

0.05      2004-10-22

  - More speed changes

  - Version 0.05, because of wrong place of 0.04-files in my CPAN dir

0.04      2004-10-21

  - speedup grammar by about 45%

  - attribute_file() and attribute_id() for getting/setting
    the /F and /ID attributes as suggested by David Thomas.

  - parser extension that reflects those attributes

  - tests

  - parsing of content in blocks of "non-problematic" characters.
    This gives less "Deep recursion" warnings.

0.03      2004-08-10

  - as_string() method

0.02      2004-05-21

  - Doc minor cleanup
