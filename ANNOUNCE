Subject: ANNOUNCE: PDF::FDF::Simple 0.02

Hi!

There is a new module on CPAN.

MODULE

  PDF::FDF::Simple - Read and write (Acrobat) FDF files.

ABOUT

  PDF::FDF::Simple reads and writes FDF files into/from hashes. FDF is
  the file format for PDF forms.

  For creating FDF files it currently only supports setting text
  values. Anyway, this should be enough to create FDF files for text
  fields, text areas, checkboxes and radio buttons. See pod
  documentation.

  The parse approach is rather pragmatic. It only searches for /Fields
  and tries to ignore the surrounding rest. This "works for me" (TM)
  but it doesn't theoretically guarantee that all possible FDFs can be
  parsed. If you have a strange FDF that cannot be parsed please send
  it to me with the expected content.
